## Tech Stack:
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node.js


## Approach:
Utilized a plant model in which users are able to create, edit, and delete listings of plants they're trying to buy/sell on the plant market community.


## MVP:
- A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express and React
- At least one model with full CRUD.
- At least three react components, defined in their own files, besides App.js.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc

## Stretch Goals Attained:
- Mobile-First Approach
- Fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) 

## Capstone MVP:
- React Router (Home Page, Listings, Contact Page)
- Animated components (hero carousel, button hovers, link hovers, key frames, etc.)
- Revamp homepage: hero section, featured, quote, grids section
- Add location to model
- Add contact page
- Add filter/search bar by location

## Capstone Stretch-Goals:
- Third Party Travel API - Google Maps for "location"
- Implementation of user login
